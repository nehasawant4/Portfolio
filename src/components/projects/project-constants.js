Developers, testers, and team members rely on it daily, yet finding the right information or understanding outdated docs is a major pain point.\n\nThis app transforms documentation into a queryable, intelligent assistant.\n\n🔍 Ask questions about platform usage, UI flows, or how to construct API payloads — the AI retrieves the exact context from Confluence or GitHub.\n\n🔧 Integrate GitHub repos to query codebases directly and understand internal APIs, handlers, or utils without reading every file.\n\n📑 Bridge the gap between code and docs — the AI detects undocumented features or mismatched Confluence pages and suggests content updates.\n\nBuilt for developer enablement, QA assistance, and living documentation, this tool doesn\'t just read your docs — it understands them, reasons with them, and keeps them in sync with your code.',

        desc:'🏥 FDA Compliance Assistant — AI-Powered SOP Review & Regulatory Alignment\n\nModern organizations face immense pressure to comply with a growing maze of regulations — from healthcare mandates like FDA, HIPAA, and GDPR, to internal policy standards and cloud security benchmarks. Yet, compliance reviews are often manual, time-consuming, and error-prone.\n\nThis app brings AI into the compliance loop — making regulatory alignment faster, smarter, and actionable.\n\n💡 Origin\nOriginally built at a hackathon hosted by Commure, this idea stemmed from the need to automate regulatory SOP reviews in hospitals. The prototype resonated so well, we kept building beyond the hackathon — turning it into a scalable AI compliance solution.\n\n🧠 What It Does\nUpload any hospital SOP or policy document (PDF)\n\nUses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to compare against FDA guidelines\n\nReturns:\n\n🔍 A detailed breakdown of matched vs missing compliance clauses\n\n✅ A checklist of AI-suggested fixes\n\n💬 A chatbot that answers Q&A based on the uploaded SOP\n\n🌍 Who Can Use It\nThis tool isn\'t just for hospitals — it\'s built for anyone navigating compliance-heavy workflows, including:\n\nCompliance Officers — ensure internal policies meet regulatory expectations\n\nLegal Teams — validate that operations are in line with laws and standards\n\nDevelopers & Designers — check accessibility and security compliance (Section 508, WCAG, cloud configs)\n\nRisk Managers — identify gaps that could expose the org to audits or fines\n\nBusinesses — validate SOPs against HIPAA, GDPR, PCI DSS, and more\n\nIndividuals — understand tax requirements and documentation\n\nMarketing Teams — align assets with brand and legal constraints\n\n🛠️ Tech Stack\nFrontend: React + TypeScript\n\nBackend: Python + Flask + Pinecone + FAISS + GPT-4\n\nDeployment: Railway (API) + Vercel (Frontend)\n\n💥 Impact\nThis AI assistant dramatically reduces the overhead of manual reviews, helps catch non-compliance early, and empowers organizations to operate with clarity, confidence, and speed — all while keeping humans in the loop.\n\n📄🔍 One PDF at a time, it\'s making compliance less painful and more precise.',
